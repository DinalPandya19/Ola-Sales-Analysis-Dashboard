# Ola-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for Ola's sales data analysis to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, profit, ride quantity, and regional trends. Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query, created calculated columns/measures using DAX, and enabled dynamic filtering by ride type, city, customer segment, and time period. The dashboard supported business decisions on driver performance, peak hours, and revenue contribution by regions.
Tools Used: Power BI Desktop, Power Query, DAX
